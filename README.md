# FEUP-COMP

A tool to generate an automaton to check if the program execution control flow is according to the one specified as a regular expression (in a subset of the PCRE format). The tool should parse the input regular expression and should generate the code to implement the automata. The tool should consider that the code of the application has been instrumented in order to identify the basic block where the program execution entered. The automata generated by the tool should consist in a Java class that will receive the info (basic block id) from the instrumented points and should process it accordingly.
